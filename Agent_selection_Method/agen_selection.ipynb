      "\n",
      "**Pros**:\n",
      "1. **Tomatoes** are a good source of vitamin C, potassium, folate, and vitamin K.\n",
      "2. **Rice** provides a good source of energy and also contains important nutrients such as B vitamins.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Cons**:\n",
      "1. **Cheese**, depending on the type and amount used, can add a considerable amount of saturated fat and sodium, which might not be ideal for heart health if consumed in large amounts.\n",
      "2. The dish could be limited in terms of variety of vegetables, meaning it might not provide a broad spectrum of vitamins and minerals.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Suggestions for improvement**:\n",
      "- Consider using whole grain rice instead of white rice for added fiber and nutrients.\n",
      "- Increase the variety and amount of vegetables, such as adding spinach, bell peppers, or onions, to enhance the fiber and nutrient content.\n",
      "- Opt for a low-fat cheese to reduce the amount of saturated fat.\n",
      "- Add some lean protein like chicken breast, tofu or beans to make it a more balanced meal.\n",
      "\n",
      "This way, you can improve the nutritional profile of the dish while still enjoying its delicious flavors.\n",

      "The Tomato Rice Casserole that you can make with rice, tomato, and cheese is quite affordable, as it uses simple and common ingredients. Here's a rough estimate of the cost:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Rice**: A bag of rice generally costs around $2-$4, and you'll be using about 1 cup. This will typically come to less than $1.\n",
      "2. **Tomato**: One or two tomatoes might cost about $1-$2 depending on the season and where you buy them from.\n",
      "3. **Cheese**: A block of cheese can start around $2 and can go up, but for one cup of shredded cheese, let's estimate this at about $1.50.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the total cost for the meal is estimated to be around $3.50 to $4.50, which should serve about 2 to 3 portions. This makes it roughly $1.50 to $2.25 per serving, making it an affordable meal option.\n",
      "\n",

This discovery could secure humanity’s future on Mars and beyond, offering a solution to the dwindling supplies from Earth due to political turmoil and environmental decay.\n",

      "As the trio sets off on their mission, they encounter various absurd challenges, like a zero-gravity zone where Jack loses his favorite wrench and spends an embarrassingly long time chasing it around, only for it to be caught by A'Lek who nonchalantly states, \"On Mars, even tools try to escape duty.\"\n",

      "Finally, facing the ancient Sentinels, A'Lek solemnly warns them of the protocol. In true human spirit, Evelyn steps forward bravely, offers a universal greeting and jokingly adds, \"Also, we brought snacks because we heard negotiations go better with Earth cookies.\"\n",

      "Even the age-old Sentinels seem to pause, perhaps perplexed or maybe just considering the offer of cookies. As the fate of Mars hangs in balance, humor, humanity's resilience, and a pack of Earth’s finest cookies might just save the day... or at least make it a memorable one!\n",

      "The situation intensified dramatically when they breached the inner sanctum of the alien structure. Administrator Rahl, in his lust for power, had sent his own team to intercept them and seize the artifact's power, triggering a violent confrontation beneath the Martian crust. The caverns echoed with the sounds of blasts and harsh commands, as both teams fought for control over humanity’s future.\n",

      "\n",
      "They reached the core of the artifact, its walls pulsating with a gentle, otherworldly glow. Evelyn, standing before the vast alien technology, felt an overwhelming sense of smallness but also a fierce determination. She spoke to the Sentinels through the artifact, her voice echoing, \"I am Evelyn Starr of Earth, and Mars. We seek balance, not domination.”\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a moment of tense silence before the chamber illuminated brightly, enveloping Evelyn and A'Lek in a radiant, warm light. The Sentinels, these monumental guardians of galactic peace, had heard her.\n",

      "Back in the battleground, Jack managed to overpower Rahl's guards, capturing Rahl himself. As reinforcements arrived, securing the rogue administrator and his followers, Jack rushed to join Evelyn, fearing the worst but hoping for a miracle.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he arrived at the artifact's core, he found Evelyn, safe, the glow fading around her. A'Lek, now partly translucent, smiled at Jack. \"Humanity may yet teach the cosmos about balance,” A’Lek remarked before fading away completely, his mission fulfilled.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jack embraced Evelyn tightly, relief and love mingling in his heart. Together, they watched as Mars, under the Sentinel's influence, began a slow transformation. The red soil shimmered slightly, hints of green flickering to life.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We did it,\" Evelyn whispered, her voice filled with awe and exhaustion.\n",

      "\"Yes,\" Jack agreed, his voice thick with emotion. \"We did it together.\"\n",
      "\n",

But your archaic methods are... quaint.\"\\n\\nAs the trio sets off on their mission, they encounter various absurd challenges, like a zero-gravity zone where Jack loses his favorite wrench and spends an embarrassingly long time chasing it around, only for it to be caught by A\\'Lek who nonchalantly states, \"On Mars, even tools try to escape duty.\"\\n\\nIn the nerve-wracking moments leading up to the climax, as they prepare to confront the Sentinels, Evelyn\\'s nervousness shows. \"I’ve dealt with difficult things before,” she says nervously, “I once had to teach my grandma how to use a smartphone.”\\n\\nJack laughs, “Trust me, if you can survive that, you can handle cosmic guardians.”\\n\\nThe tension breaks when, during a stealth moment, they accidentally activate an ancient Martian disco ball, causing a light and sound spectacle. Jack quips, “Well, if we can’t talk them into a truce, maybe we can dance them into one?”\\n\\nFinally, facing the ancient Sentinels, A\\'Lek solemnly warns them of the protocol. In true human spirit, Evelyn steps forward bravely, offers a universal greeting and jokingly adds, \"Also, we brought snacks because we heard negotiations go better with Earth cookies.\"\\n\\nEven the age-old Sentinels seem to pause, perhaps perplexed or maybe just considering the offer of cookies. As the fate of Mars hangs in balance, humor, humanity\\'s resilience, and a pack of Earth’s finest cookies might just save the day... or at least make it a memorable one!', 'name': 'ComedyBot', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': 'The gravity of their mission couldn\\'t be overstated, yet in these pivotal moments, their bursts of humor were their lifeline, providing a temporary respite from the weight pressing on their shoulders.\\n\\nThe situation intensified dramatically when they breached the inner sanctum of the alien structure. Administrator Rahl, in his lust for power, had sent his own team to intercept them and seize the artifact\\'s power, triggering a violent confrontation beneath the Martian crust. The caverns echoed with the sounds of blasts and harsh commands, as both teams fought for control over humanity’s future.\\n\\nJack found himself pinned down, exchanging fire with Rahl\\'s elite guards. \"Evelyn, you need to go!\" he shouted over the roar of gunfire. \"This isn\\'t just about Mars anymore—it\\'s about what’s right for the universe!\"\\n\\nTears streaked Evelyn’s face, her resolve hardening. \"I’m not leaving you!\" she protested, her voice breaking amid the chaos.\\n\\nA\\'Lek intervened, his voice calm yet firm, \"Evelyn, the Sentinels are awakening. We must act now.\" As he spoke, the ground trembled, dust cascading from the ancient ceilings, a stark reminder of the powers at play.\\n\\nEvelyn looked at Jack, their shared history and budding feelings colliding in her heart. With a shaky breath, she nodded, turning to follow A\\'Lek. Jack gave her a brave smile, his eyes conveying a silent promise of reunion.\\n\\nThey reached the core of the artifact, its walls pulsating with a gentle, otherworldly glow. Evelyn, standing before the vast alien technology, felt an overwhelming sense of smallness but also a fierce determination. She spoke to the Sentinels through the artifact, her voice echoing, \"I am Evelyn Starr of Earth, and Mars. We seek balance, not domination.”\\n\\nThere was a moment of tense silence before the chamber illuminated brightly, enveloping Evelyn and A\\'Lek in a radiant, warm light. The Sentinels, these monumental guardians of galactic peace, had heard her.\\n\\nBack in the battleground, Jack managed to overpower Rahl\\'s guards, capturing Rahl himself. As reinforcements arrived, securing the rogue administrator and his followers, Jack rushed to join Evelyn, fearing the worst but hoping for a miracle.\\n\\nAs he arrived at the artifact\\'s core, he found Evelyn, safe, the glow fading around her. A\\'Lek, now partly translucent, smiled at Jack. \"Humanity may yet teach the cosmos about balance,” A’Lek remarked before fading away completely, his mission fulfilled.\\n\\nJack embraced Evelyn tightly, relief and love mingling in his heart. Together, they watched as Mars, under the Sentinel\\'s influence, began a slow transformation. The red soil shimmered slightly, hints of green flickering to life.\\n\\n\"We did it,\" Evelyn whispered, her voice filled with awe and exhaustion.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" Jack agreed, his voice thick with emotion. \"We did it together.\"\\n\\nAnd as Mars began its rebirth, under the watchful eyes of the Sentinels, humanity also stepped into a new dawn, bonded forever by the red soil of a world that had tested them to the fullest but also taught them the true value of unity and sacrifice.', 'name': 'DramaBot', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': '', 'role': 'assistant', 'name': 'User'}, {'content': '', 'role': 'assistant', 'name': 'User'}], summary='', cost={'usage_including_cached_inference': {'total_cost': 0}, 'usage_excluding_cached_inference': {'total_cost': 0}}, human_input=[])"

      "   - For macOS, check System Preferences > Energy Saver.\n",
      "\n",
